# Statistic Types
# Statistic	Description
# component-count	Number of unique components
# contig-L50	Number of contigs that are longer than, or equal to, the N50 length
# contig-N50	Contig length at which 50% of total bases in assembly are in contigs of that length or greater
# contig-count	Number of contigs
# gc-perc	gc-count/atgc-count as percentage
# molecule-count	Number of chromosomes and plasmids in full assembly
# region-count	Number of genomic regions defined in full assembly
# scaffold-L50	Number of scaffolds that are longer than, or equal to, the N50 length
# scaffold-N50	Scaffold length at which 50% of total bases in assembly are in scaffolds of that length or greater
# scaffold-N75	Scaffold length at which 75% of total bases in assembly are in contigs of that length or greater
# scaffold-N90	scaffold length at which 90% of total bases in assembly are in contigs of that length or greater
# scaffold-count	Number of scaffolds
# spanned-gaps	Number of spanned gaps. Spanned gaps are gaps within a scaffold
# top-level-count	Number of chromosomes or plasmids, unplaced/unlocalized scaffolds, alt-loci scaffolds, and patch scaffolds
# total-gap-length	Total length of gaps
# total-length	Total sequence length including bases and gaps
# ungapped-length	Total length excluding gaps
# unspanned-gaps	Number of unspanned gaps. Unspanned gaps are gaps between scaffolds
#
# Sequence-type Description
# all	statistic covers all the sequences in the unit-assembly and molecule(s) specified.
# molecule	statistic covers the specified molecule. molecule-name and molecule-type/loc will be given.
# unlocalized	statistic covers the sequences assigned to a molecule but with no position. molecule-name and molecule-type/loc will be given.
# unplaced	statistic covers the sequences not assigned to any molecule in the assembly.
